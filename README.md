# basicGeneticAlgorithm
A basic genetic algorithm developed from scratch in python.

The genetic algorithm finds the optimal combination if items to store in a backpack based on their weight and value. The items in the backpack cannot exceed a weight of 250; however, under this constraint we want to maximize the total value of the items in the backpack.
